# QuickOpen
An android app to quickly open your most used apps through a notification.

# TODO
- add UI
- change notificationIcon
- make NotificationService start at boot
- add better texts and explanations to settings-page
- add settings-icon instead of hidden-menu-entry
- add "Donate a beer" ?
- hide option "VISIBILITY_PRIVATE" because there will never be "sensitive data" to hide on lockscreen ?
